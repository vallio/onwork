This blog captures my memories of work. From my time working as a paperboy, gas station attendant, golf course starter, and for the past 35 years in technology. These are experiences, not lessons. Lessons are for you to learn, to earn. 

This image expresses my experiences as a foreigner in Beijing as captured by my daughter. Image copyright - Lydia Allio.
